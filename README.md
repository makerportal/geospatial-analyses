# Geospatial Analyses in Python
Python-based geospatial analysis codes related to: GOES-16 satellite data, national land cover database (NLCD), elevation maps, building footprints, city mapping across the Continental USA

## Shapefiles and Rasters
This folder contains codes that plot city shapefiles in Python using 'cartopy' 
This folder also contains codes that plot the national land cover database (NLCD) product across the USA and given cities

These codes are the backbone of the satellite analyses

*Examples*:

## Geostationary Satellite
This folder contains codes that plot geostationary satellite data (GOES-16/GOES-17)
